# Machine-Learning-Project
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset includes various features such as passenger demographics, ticket information, and cabin details, which are used to build predictive models.

## Project Goals
Data Exploration: Analyze the Titanic dataset to understand the features and their relationships with survival rates.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Model Development: Implement various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) to predict survival.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Create visualizations to present findings and insights from the data analysis and model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers, including:

Passenger Class (Pclass)
Name
Sex
Age
Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp)
Parents/Children Aboard (Parch)
Ticket Number
Fare
Cabin
Embarked Port (C, Q, S)
